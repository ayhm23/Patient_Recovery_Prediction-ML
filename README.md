# Patient Recovery Prediction - ML  
Predicting patient recovery outcomes using machine-learning  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This repository presents a machine-learning workflow designed to predict recovery outcomes for patients. It covers the full pipeline from data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and serialization of the final model for deployment.  
  
### Key objectives  
- Analyse a dataset of patient features (clinical/demographic) and recovery labels.  
- Explore data patterns, distributions and feature-target relationships.  
- Preprocess and engineer features to optimise model input.  
- Train & compare multiple supervised learning algorithms.  
- Select the best model, evaluate its performance and save it for future use.  
- Provide reproducible code, visualisations and documentation for ease of use.

## 🧮 Dataset Description  
- **Source**: Provide dataset origin (e.g., hospital records, public health dataset)  
- **Features**: Describe key columns (e.g., age, gender, diagnosis code, treatment type, recovery days)  
- **Target**: Recovery outcome (e.g., binary label: Recovered / Not Recovered, or multi-class)  
- **Size**: Number of rows, number of features, any missing values, etc.  
- **Notes**: Any important caveats (imbalanced classes, missing data patterns, outliers)  

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing  
- Overview of EDA: distribution of features, correlations, target class imbalance.  
- Visualisations: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps of feature correlations.  
- Preprocessing steps:  
  - Missing value handling (drop/impute)  
  - Encoding of categorical variables (one-hot / label encoding)  
  - Feature scaling/normalisation (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)  
  - Feature engineering (creating new features, aggregating)  
  - Train/test split (e.g., 80/20) and/or cross-validation setup.  

## 🧠 Model Development  
- Algorithms tried: e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine.  
- Hyper-parameter tuning: GridSearchCV / RandomisedSearchCV details.  
- Metrics used to evaluate: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix.  
- Model comparison table summarising performance.  
- Selection of the final model based on metrics and business-/clinical-relevance.  

## 📊 Final Results & Insights  
- Present the best model’s performance: e.g., “Random Forest achieved ROC-AUC = 0.87, recall = 0.82 for the ‘Recovered’ class.”  
- Highlight key features driving predictions (feature importance).  
- Clinical/business meaning: e.g., age and treatment duration were the top predictors of recovery.  
- Limitations: e.g., small dataset size, class imbalance, potential bias, generalisability.  
- Future work: e.g., incorporating more features, using deep learning / time-series data, deploying as a web app.  

## 🛠 Usage Instructions  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ayhm23/Patient_Recovery_Prediction-ML.git  
   cd Patient_Recovery_Prediction-ML  
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Prepare data:

   * Place raw data into `data/raw/`
   * Run `src/0_data_loading.py` (if applicable)
   * Run `src/1_eda.py` to generate visualisations
   * Run `src/2_preprocessing.py` to clean/prepare data
4. Train models:

   ```bash
   python src/3_model_training.py  
   ```
5. Evaluate models:

   ```bash
   python src/4_model_evaluation.py  
   ```
6. The final model artefact is saved in `models/` and visualisations/results in `visualizations/` & `output/`.
7. To deploy/use the model: load the saved model and feed new data (same preprocessing pipeline) to get predictions.

## 🔧 Reproducibility & Environment

* Python version: e.g., 3.9+
* Key libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, joblib or pickle.
* For reproducible results: set random seeds in code (e.g., `np.random.seed(42)`, `random_state=42`).
* If using Jupyter notebooks, document any versioning or dependencies.

If you like, I can **generate a fully customised README** using the project-report PDF (so the dataset details, model results, etc match exactly) and format it ready to paste in GitHub. Would you like me to do that?
